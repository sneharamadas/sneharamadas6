A Scrum Game experience: project for SER 515 by group Bhalerao

Front_End has the code for front end of the project
Back_End has the code for back end of the project

Sprint 1 has been completed, and the final sprint 1 code resides in [sprint-1](https://github.com/avashis9/ScrumPlay/tree/sprint-1) branch.

We have merged the Sprint 2 final code to master, but to run, pull the code from [sprint-2](https://github.com/avashis9/ScrumPlay/tree/sprint-2) branch.

To run the code via command line:

Start the backend (server) first. Head to the back end foler and run  `mvn clean install` (assuming you have maven installed)

Dependencies for backend have been mentioned in the [pom.xml](https://github.com/avashis9/ScrumPlay/blob/sprint-1/Back_End/ScrumPlay/pom.xml) file.
 
Dependencies for the front end have been mentioned in [pom.xml](https://github.com/avashis9/ScrumPlay/blob/sprint-1/Front_End/pom.xml) file.

ScrumPlay has been developed and tested in [Intellij IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac) using java 20 and [springboot](https://spring.io/blog/2023/08/24/spring-boot-3-1-3-available-now). 


Make sure to have java 20 and [SpringBoot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.0.2.RELEASE/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html) installed.

Make sure to install [maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) if not already there with spring.

If in intellij, Go to `File > Invalidate Caches..`, this will restart the IDE.

To install dependencies go to directory of [pom.xml](https://github.com/avashis9/ScrumPlay/blob/sprint-1/Back_End/ScrumPlay/pom.xml) file and run `maven clean install`. This should install the dependencies.

We need to start the server first, so run [ScrumPlayApplication.java](https://github.com/avashis9/ScrumPlay/tree/sprint-1/Back_End/ScrumPlay/src/main/java/com/Bhalerao/ScrumPlay) File. This should start a Server at localhost:8080.

If [ScrumPlayApplication.java](https://github.com/avashis9/ScrumPlay/tree/sprint-1/Back_End/ScrumPlay/src/main/java/com/Bhalerao/ScrumPlay) file doesn't show an active Run button, Right-click on src Directory in the left project pane and select `Mark Directory as > Sources Root`.

Then to run Front end, run the file [main.java](https://github.com/avashis9/ScrumPlay/tree/sprint-1/Front_End/src/ScrumPlay_FrontEnd).

Scrumplay in sprint 1 should work as shown in this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eZcjeuM4vbri7CjEru6Uf8k25ZwzS1gl/view?usp=drive_link)

Scrumplay in sprint 2 should work as shown in this [video](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1jqJFsyjVWlW3amp62euxnMEnoHehf_fU) 


For Sprint 2, run the code from sprint-2 branch.

For Sprint 3, run the code from sprint-3 branch.
